- clean up tests - probably don't need 80 of them
- make slack connection more reliable - restart in case of failure
- simplify agent logic - let the LLM think. Update prompt to think, tool call, think, repeat
- update max iterations to be 20
- check that everything works if building from scratch
- ensure that local works - not just cloud. local should still be at localhost:4000
- latency - don't reinitialize every time
- add claude as an option
- feature backlog: passive listening, , etc.
